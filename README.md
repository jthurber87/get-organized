## Overview
---
Organization will set you free. The less time you're spending moving around windows, searching for bookmarks, or navigating through menus, the more time you'll be able to spend on what you came here to do: learn! We're going to go through a few tools, tips, and tricks to make your lives easier!

## Objectives
---
- Learn how to use Rectangle for window organization

- Consider good folder management

- Talk about some best practices for Slack

- Discover helpful hotkeys

- Discuss keeping a good bookmarks folder!

## Rectangle

Rectangle will allow us to use hotkeys to move windows to a certain part of our screens!

[Download Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)

A few useful hotkeys:
- <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>up</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd>/<kbd>down</kbd>/<kbd>left</kbd> :
    - Snaps window to the top / right / bottom / left portion of the screen
- <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd>/<kbd>i</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd>/<kbd>j</kbd> :
    - Snaps window to the upper-left / upper-right / bottom-right / bottom-left portion of the screen
- <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>return</kbd> :
    - Maximizes the window to the screen

By keeping an organized file/folder structure, we don't have to spend time looking for where things are!

We already did this on day one, but here's what your SEIR folder should look like!

I can't imagine a more beautiful thing ðŸ¥¹
## Slack Tools

![Slack](https://media1.giphy.com/media/l2Sq3uQOW4b325vSo/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47ljvolsmusu99isesbk5uml7w3hviahszfr45wtqu&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)
We're going to be using Slack a lot throughout this course, especially to ask questions. It stands to reason that we should be asking them correctly.

Things to include in a Slack question:

1. What is supposed to be happening?
2. What is currently happening?
3. The block of code that seems to be the issue
    - You can use triple backticks (```) or <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to enter a code block
4. A screenshot of what's going on (more on that in a minute)

Things to consider before posting a question:

1. Have you checked your resources to find the answer? 
    - This includes lectures, the questions channel, MDN and Google
2. Has someone else asked this question recently? 
    - You should be paying attention during class! An error that someone else is having now might be one you have later

Of course we're here to answer questions, and never want you to feel like you can't or shouldn't speak up if you have one! But one of the most important skills you should develop is resourcefulness, and you might be surprised at how easy it can be to find an answer on your own!

## Zoom

- Don't forget to put your hand down when you're done asking a question! 
- <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> splits the cameras and the screen share into two different windows. Try it out!

## Mac Hotkeys

Taking advantage of hotkeys will save you time, energy, and make you feel like a hacker! Here are some useful ones:
- <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd> to take a screenshot
- <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd> to take a screenshot of what you click and drag over
- <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd> to take a screenshot where you define the borders
- <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd> will quit completely out of the program you're on
- <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd> will usually close the tab you're on
- <kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> will usually quit out of a terminal operation

## Bookmarks

Have you checked out the **Additional Resources** section of our [class wiki](https://github.com/SEI-R-9-19/class_wiki) yet? There are a TON of valuable links you should bookmark! In addition, if you find something useful, add it to your own coding bookmark folder so you don't lose it!
